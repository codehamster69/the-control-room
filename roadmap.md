> Scope: gameplay and progression guidance excluding marketplace and tickets.

## 1) First-time setup

1. **Sign in** with your account from the main page.
2. **Verify Instagram** when prompted:
   - Enter your Instagram username.
   - Generate the verification code.
   - Place the code in your Instagram bio.
   - Press verify before the code expires.
3. Once verified, the main dashboard unlocks your core routes:
   - **Hunt**
   - **Armory**
   - **Ranking**
   - **Community**

## 2) Core gameplay loop (repeat daily)

1. Start a **Hunt** session.
2. Wait until your session completes.
3. **Collect items** from the completed session.
4. Review your inventory in **Armory**.
5. Sell selected items for berries/tokens when needed.
6. Reinvest berries into hunt bot upgrades.
7. Track progress and rank in **Ranking**.

## 3) Hunt strategy roadmap

### Phase A — Early game (Day 1–3)

- Prioritize the **free hunt** whenever available.
- Learn your cadence: run → collect → reinvest.
- Avoid overspending berries early; keep enough to maintain momentum.

### Phase B — Growth (Week 1)

- Start using **paid hunts** when your token flow is stable.
- Upgrade in this order for compounding returns:
  1. Bot items/hour
  2. Runtime
  3. Cost/hour efficiency
  4. Satellite

### Phase C — Optimization (Week 2+)

- Balance free and paid hunts around your play schedule.
- Buy upgrades in chunks when possible for better progression jumps.
- Keep sessions running as consistently as possible to maximize gain.

## 4) Armory strategy roadmap

### Inventory management

- Use filters to separate:
  - Current inventory
  - Collection history
  - Sell view
- Keep higher-value/rarer items when building power.
- Sell excess lower-priority stock to fund hunt growth.

### Selling discipline

Use sell modes based on objective:

- **Individual**: precise control when you need small amounts of berries.
- **Category**: clean out one rarity tier quickly.
- **All**: emergency liquidity (usually least efficient long-term).

---

## 5) Ranking strategy roadmap

- Watch **Global** rank for long-term progress.
- Watch **Monthly** rank for seasonal pushes.
- Use leaderboard search to benchmark against similar players.
- Do focused “push windows” before monthly reset to climb faster.

---

## 6) Profile and social features

- Use your profile to monitor:
  - Total power
  - Monthly power gain
  - Inventory and collection
  - Hunt bot levels
- Community page gives access to official links and group spaces.
- Keep Instagram linked and healthy; relink only when necessary.

---

## 7) Suggested weekly operating plan

### Daily

- Claim free hunt when available.
- Run paid hunts if profitable.
- Always collect completed hunts before ending session.

### Every 2–3 days

- Review armory.
- Sell planned surplus.
- Reinvest into upgrades.

### Weekly

- Check ranking trend (global + monthly).
- Adjust upgrade priorities based on bottleneck:
  - Too few items? increase items/hour.
  - Too short runs? increase runtime.
  - Costly runs? improve cost/hour.

### Monthly

- Plan a final ranking push before reset.
- Preserve enough berries for continuous hunt uptime.
